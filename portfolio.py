    # Project: LinkedIn Job Seeker Tool
    st.markdown("### üîç LinkedIn Job Seeker Tool")
    st.write("""
    The purpose of this tool is to assist LinkedIn job seekers with little to no coding experience.
    It helps:
    - Decompress the overwhelming number of applications by focusing on suitable roles.
    - Avoid ghost jobs and optimize the time spent applying.
    
    This project highlights my proactive approach to problem-solving: while others may complain about inefficiencies, I take strategic action to address and solve them.
